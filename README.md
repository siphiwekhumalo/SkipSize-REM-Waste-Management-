A modern, responsive web application designed to simplify skip size selection for WeWantWaste customers. Built with React, TypeScript, and featuring an engaging 3D animated interface with real-time filtering and interactive 360-degree product visualization.
## ðŸŽ¨ Design Approach & Redesign Philosophy
### Our Redesign Strategy
This project represents a complete reimagining of the traditional skip selection experience, moving away from conventional layouts to create a modern, engaging interface that reflects WeWantWaste's commitment to innovation.
#### Key Design Principles
1. **Angular Modernism**: Implemented hexagonal and angular card shapes to break away from standard rectangular layouts
2. **Authentic Data Integration**: Replaced all mock data with real WeWantWaste pricing and container specifications
3. **Immersive Visualization**: Created 360-degree product viewers using authentic WeWantWaste container images
4. **Performance-First**: Optimized every interaction for sub-200ms response times with hardware acceleration
#### Visual Design Evolution
- **From**: Standard grid layouts with basic cards
- **To**: Angular, hexagonal cards with clipped corners and dynamic shadows
- **From**: Static product images
- **To**: Interactive 360-degree container visualization with authentic WeWantWaste imagery
- **From**: Basic filtering dropdowns
- **To**: Sticky sidebar with real-time filtering and visual feedback
- **From**: Traditional mobile hamburger menus
- **To**: Slide-out filter panels with haptic feedback and smooth animations
#### Technical Innovation
- **Three.js Background**: Animated particle system creating depth and movement
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU-optimized transforms for 60fps interactions
- **Micro-interactions**: Every button press, filter selection, and card interaction provides immediate visual feedback
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works seamlessly across all devices while leveraging modern browser capabilities
